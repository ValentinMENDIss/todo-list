# **Todo-list**

Todo-list is a good looking application made on python using the customtkinter module. 
With this application you can Write, Save and even Read last / all notes that have been saved.


You can freely use it and customize it for your needs :)


## Why was it made?
It was made for fun and educational purposes (to learn more about tkinter/customtkinter).

## How to install?
To install just simply pull the code / install  it. then install all dependencies from "requirements.txt" file.
To install dependencies / modules from it, open powershell / terminal in that directory and write: 
_pip install -r requirements.txt_ 

## If it doesn't work
If it doesn't work there might be different approaches to fix the issue.
Try to install dependencies second time to see if everything was installed properly.
The problem that might appear by a lot of people, is that tkinter module is not present by default in python. 
If it is true, look for the package that you can install to get python 'tkinter' module, as it is named differently on all distros/OSes.

*Here are some examples:*

sudo pacman -S tk
sudo apt-get install python3-tk 
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

If you still have an error while trying to open the application/code, or other erros while using it, please mention about it (post an issue on this repository).

*Thanks for installing and your attention.* 
*Have fun :)*
